Go to System Settings and update the following:

cloudflare.api_key = your CloudFlare api key, this is visible on the Account tab of CloudFlare https://www.cloudflare.com/my-account

cloudflare.email_address = The email address associated with the account (the one you use to log in to CloudFlare)

Optional context/system settings

cloudflare.skip = 1; ignore this context when clearing global cache

cloudflare.use_dev = 1; enable CloudFlare Development mode when clearing the global cache

Please note that PurgeCloudFlare relies on your http_host setting to tell CloudFlare which domain/account to clear files from, if you're using multiple contexts they will each need this setting.

Ignoring a context: if you do not wish PurgeCloudFlare to attempt to clear the CloudFlare cache for a specific context, add a context setting named 'cloudflare.skip' and set its value to 1

Once you have done this, MODX will clear your CloudFlare Cache every time the system-wide cache is cleared, and will clear individual pages when they are saved from the MODX manager

UPDATE: Saving a page will also clear the parents of the saved page (not doing this was confusing many of our clients, so I'd assume you were having similar issues with your own)
