PurgeCloudFlareV4
=================

##What is PurgeCloudFlareV4?
This is a fork of PurgeCloudFlare created by Jason Carney: https://github.com/DashMedia/PurgeCloudFlare

##Why a fork?
Because the good original PurgeCloudFlare uses an outdated version of CloudFlare API which will be discontinued on Nov 2016.
The original project seems to be not maintained anymore and I would like to share my code with other MODX developers who would like to use CloudFlare CDN.

##So, what are the differences betweend PurgeCloudFlare and PurgeCloudFlareV4
PurgeCloudFlareV4 uses the new CloudFlare API V4
